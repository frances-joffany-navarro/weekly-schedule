# L'horaire
This project is a weekly scheduling application where the user can add, edit, delete their schedule and shows there weekly schedules. This is a personal project and I am currently working on it since October 2022. 

I am currently working a partime job in HORECA sector and while doing this job, I got an idea and wanted to create an appliction where I can see my schedule easily and clearly and also to check out who am I working with on that day. But for now I want to make an application where it will show my schedule for a week.
